# Predicting-Traffic-Congestion-Suggesting-Optimal-Routes
This project aims to predict traffic congestion using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Linear Regression, and to suggest optimal routes based on these predictions using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project demonstrates the integration of machine learning models with graph-based algorithms to solve real-world problems in traffic management.

Project Overview
Traffic congestion is a significant problem in urban areas, leading to increased travel time, fuel consumption, and pollution. This project uses AI models to predict traffic congestion levels and adjusts route recommendations accordingly to optimize travel time.

Features
Traffic Congestion Prediction: Utilizes CNNs and Linear Regression to predict traffic congestion levels based on input images.
Optimal Route Suggestion: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a grid-based road network, considering congestion levels.
Data Simulation: Generates dummy traffic data for training and testing the models.
Visualization: Provides visual comparison of model predictions and true values.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
TensorFlow & Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
Scikit-learn: For Linear Regression and model evaluation.
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizations.
Logging: For tracking the progress and debugging.
